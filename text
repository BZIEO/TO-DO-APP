Pseudocode:

I will need a box to contain everything

Within the box will be an input box with a button

The input box is used to write what needs to be done, and a button to add it to a list

The list item will have a check mark to mark complete and cause to dissappear/place check mark next to it

The list item will have a delete button to delete if doesn't need to be done/input by accident
